# Approach

## Problem

![Problem 172](problem_image.png)

## Initial thoughts

The problem itself isn't too hard. It's mainly the follow up that is difficult.

## Initial attempt

The way I did it was just find the factorial using `math.factorial()`, and then stripped the string converted integer of its zeroes.

## Obstacles

THe main obstacle was finding a way to do it in log time. 

## Conclusion/Things I would do differently

After looking at other solutions, I don't think I would have come up with the fastest methods myself. I guess now that I know the trick (find the number of times you multiply by 5, including higher multiples), I'd theoretically would be able to solve it next time.
