# Approach

## Problem

![Problem 098](problem_image.png)

## Initial thoughts

Checking to see if BST is legit. Simplest way is to just inorder search to check if things are aligned properly.

## Initial attempt

Use recursion to inorder search the tree. I took an easy way out of thinking about recursion by just using two outside variables. One to keep track of the last node's value, and the other to see if the BST is ever invalid.

## Obstacles

The main obstacle was thinking recursively, so I just didn't.

## Conclusion/Things I would do differently

There are definitely cleaner ways of implementing this, I just didn't have time today.
